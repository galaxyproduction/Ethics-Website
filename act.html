          <li>An Act Utilitarianism view would say that giving these backdoors into this software could potentially save millions of peoples lives.</li>
          <li>Encryption gives us the ability to communicate back and forth, which helps the vast majority of the people as well as business.</li>
          <li>However, because it would lead to greater chances of capturing criminals having this backdoor is ethical according to Act Utilitarianism because the need for a safer society is greater than that of a private society.</li>

        <ol class="is-lower-alpha">
          <li>It is not practical or the issue is too complex to accurately judge the issue.</li>
          <li>The scale by which the situation is judged can shift depending on the person and their scope of morality.</li>
          <li>Act Utilitarianism ignores our innate sense of duty.</li>
          <li>Only possible consequences and outcomes are taken into account and these situations can be miscalculated in time, scope, and certainty causing us to take the wrong course of action when judging an action already taken, or one about to
            undergone.</li>
